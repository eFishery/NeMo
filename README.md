# NeMo Whataspp ChatBot 

A simple question answer like chatbot to simplify you data input.

# How to run 

to run you need to have enviroment variable as in `.env.example`, rename it to `.env`, by default you need to create `coral` dir or you can specify by env var `CORAL_DIR`. The `coral` dir is for the bot configuration, so create a `coral` directory and put all the coral file in this folder, also you need the WhatsApp session file in order to connect to the current phone

Use this tools to generate the whatsapp session file [k1m0ch1/WhatsappLogin](https://github.com/k1m0ch1/WhatsappLogin), you can download the latest binary file from [the latest release](https://github.com/k1m0ch1/WhatsappLogin/releases/)

and run with command `./WhatsappLogin -p 08123123123` and scan the QR

or

run with docker 

```
docker run --rm -v sessions:/go/src/github.com/k1m0ch1/WhatsappLogin/sessions k1m0ch1/whatsapplogin:latest -p 08123123123
```

after you have file `08123123123.gob` and `coral` directory with `basic.yml` inside, run the NeMo with this command 

```
./NeMo 08123123123
```

this will find the file `08123123123.gob` in the `SESSION_DIR` environment variable by default this will goes to current directory running file

# Run With Docker

you must prepare the `coral` directory include with yaml file and Whatsapp file session, after that mount volume in docker with example command like this

```
docker run \
--name NeMo -v $(pwd)/coral:/app/coral \
-v $(pwd)/.sessions/08123123123.gob:/app/08123123123.gob \
k1m0ch1/nemo 08123123123
```

## Understand Basic Coral Configuration

Coral as in the house of the clown fish, is the configuration of the bot in order to specific give the operation to NeMo, you can see the example from the `basic.yml` or `example.yml` file

### Author 

Specifically to define the author of the configuration

```YAML
author:
  name: name
  phone: "08123123123"
  email: email@email.com
```

### Default Greeting

This will be triggered when users chat any text to NeMo and start to send `message` and expected by the variable `expected_users`

```YAML
default_greeting:
  message: "to start talk with me type\n\n*!start*"
```

**note: default greeting will never sent to group

### Commands


just remember if you want to record or in run process after triggering the commands, but the `True` value for `record` and `run_process`

```YAML
commands:
  prefix: "!"
  command: "start"
  record: True
  run_process: True
  message: "Let's start how cool you are"
```

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dkFUFXoJjMzMj0OeIV-K7Q.png)

you can use the message with the URL POST with format `{{URL}}` with POST method

for example if you type `!start hello` in the chat, the NeMo will sent the body like in the Webhook part and the `hello` will be inserted in the question part.

### Process

This configuration define the question after commands triggered, for a 

in order to use validation rule `image`, you need to specify `AWS S3` configuration in `.env` file

```YAML
process:
  timeout: 300
  exit_command:
    prefix: "!"
    command: stop
    message: "alright I'll stop asking"
  end_message: "Hey its done, thank you"
  questions:
    - question:
        slug: first
        asking: please take a pic your beautiful face
        validation:
          rule: image
          message: "must a pic dude!"
    - question:
        slug: second
        asking: tell me some random number
        validation:
          rule: ^[0-9]*$
          message: you can't read that ? I ask you to write some number
```

### Webhook

In order to save the input data, you can rely on webhook that built in this ChatBot

```YAML
webhook:
  service: WEBHOOK
  url: https://url.com/webhook
```

the data will be sent with `POST` method to `url` key with body `JSON` like this


```JSON
{
 "phone_number": "628123123123",
 "current_process": "basic",
 "current_question_slug": 1,
 "process_status": "DONE",
 "data": [
  {
   "slug": "first",
   "question": "please take a pic your beautiful face",
   "answer": "https=//public-tools.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/fresh/nemo/645C4CC4141DB97B2A29BBE33725B1BE.jpeg",
   "created": "2020-09-25T13:54:56+07:00"
  },
  {
   "slug": "second",
   "question": "tell me some random number",
   "answer": "1200",
   "created": "2020-09-25T13:55:17+07:00"
  }
 ],
 "sent": "",
 "sent_to": "",
 "created": "2020-09-25T13:54:19+07:00",
 "expired": "2020-09-25T13:59:19+07:00",
 "finished": "2020-09-25T13:55:17+07:00"
}
```

### Expected Users

is a list of a phone number that expected by ChatBot, technically a whitelist that chatbot will hear, currenlt I made this for a specific phone number, because I'm not making this for "any" users, currently I want to made that, but I need more validation to implement that

```YAML
expected_users:
  - 628123123123
  - 628321321312
```

you can set the `expected_users` to `any` so this will targeted the `any` user for `command` and `default_greeting` but the `schedules` will be disabled due to `any` users.

to activate bot in group you can just simply add the `phonenumber-groupid`

```YAML
expected_users:
  - any
```

in order for NeMo can run within WhatsApp, you need the whatsapp file session

## Generate WhatsApp File Session

Use this tools to generate the whatsapp session file [k1m0ch1/WhatsappLogin](https://github.com/k1m0ch1/WhatsappLogin)

you can download the latest binary file from [the latest release](https://github.com/k1m0ch1/WhatsappLogin/releases/)

and run with command `./WhatsappLogin -p 08123123123` and scan the QR

or

run with docker 

```
docker run --rm -v sessions:/go/src/github.com/k1m0ch1/WhatsappLogin/sessions k1m0ch1/whatsapplogin:latest -p 08123123123
```


# Development Environment

## How to run

`go run . 08123123123`

this will find the file `08123123123.session` in the `SESSION_DIR` environment variable by default this will goes to current directory running file


## To Do


[] need to validate if the ChatBot already sent the message, so he will not sent a duplicate message

[] weird file session JSON error parsing, weirdly added the `"":"}` string in the end

[] build for ANY expected users, along with the builder

[] if error logging in, try to re-login

[] YAM file can be `.yaml` or `.yml`, currently only `yml` is validated

## Done List

[] ~~Multi Schedule is not~~

[] ~~Multi file yml with some with no greeting or no schedule or no commands~~

[] ~~must test all the builder work well~~

[] ~ada orang yang nyangkut gara gara status NEXT nya diem, bisanya nge break pas ada ~

[] ~~semua bentuk dokumen harus di kasih handler~~

[] ~~ada orang yg kirim gambar langsung tanpa command atau session apapun, langsung ngebreak soalnya dia mencoba coral yg tidak exist~~

[] ~~kirim gambar langsung modar~~

[] ~~ga ada sesinya langsung modar, masalah di image handler~~
